# BreastCancerPrediction
In this machine learning project we are using sklearn dataset for getting the breast cancer dataset. We are using logistic regression as the model to predict whether the breast cancer is malignant or benign. We have also found the accuracy of the training and test data so as that it can give accurate predictions.
